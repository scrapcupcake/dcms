#Designer Content Management System
This projects goal is to provide a simple to deploy, fast to load content management system using Angular 2 to enable designers to make use of the growing web component ecosystem.

Uses Angular2-Univeral to server render both the frontend client and a seperate editor client, that will eventually be secured with a simple login system and JWT for the apis.

Current status: Non-functional, uploading to report a bug to the angular2-universal-starter, on which this project is based
